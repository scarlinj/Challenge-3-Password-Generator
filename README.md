# Password Generator

Welcome to the Password Generator!  Here you can answer a series of prompts to define features for your password.  This includes the length of the password and if you want to include numbers, letters, or special characters.  Try it out to generate your own secure password!

## Bugs

Currently this displays results as a mix of "NaN" values instead of the values needed.

## Using the generator

Navigate to the website to load the Generator: https://scarlinj.github.io/Password-Generator/
From here, you can click the button "Generate Password" to open a modal that will ask you a series of questions to define features for your password.  After you answer the prompts a randomly-generated password will populate in the text box on the screen.  You can copy this using the button provided and paste it where you please.
