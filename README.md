## Using the generator

Navigate to the website to load the Generator: https://scarlinj.github.io/Password-Generator/
From here, you can click the button "Generate Password" to open a modal that will ask you a series of questions to define features for your password.  After you answer the prompts a randomly-generated password will populate in the text box on the screen.  You can copy this using the button provided and paste it where you please.

I will add a history of previous password generated.
